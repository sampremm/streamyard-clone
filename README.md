# StreamYard Clone

A browser-based streaming platform that enables users to record content and stream live to platforms like Facebook, YouTube, and other destinations. The project uses WebRTC for peer-to-peer communication, MediaRecorder API for in-browser recording, and an RTMP server with FFmpeg for video processing and streaming.

## Features

- üé• **Recording Studio**: Record audio and video directly in the browser.
- üì° **Live Streaming**: Stream live to multiple platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, and others.
- üîÑ **Point-to-Point Streaming**: Enable direct peer-to-peer streaming with low latency using WebRTC.
- ‚ö° **Real-Time Communication**: Powered by Socket.IO for seamless real-time data exchange.
- üìÅ **Cloud Integration**: Option to upload recorded content to cloud storage.
- üõ†Ô∏è **FFmpeg Integration**: Video processing and transcoding managed through FFmpeg in the RTMP server.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Streaming**: WebRTC, Nginx RTMP Server, MediaRecorder API, FFmpeg (in Docker)
- **Real-Time Communication**: Socket.IO
- **Containerization**: Docker
